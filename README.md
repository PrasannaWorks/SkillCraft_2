# Task-2: Random Number Guessing Game Using Java
Introduction:
As part of my internship learning tasks, Task-2 focuses on building a console-based interactive Java application that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it.
This task is designed to strengthen understanding of:
1. Random number generation

2. User interaction through console input

3. Conditional logic

4. Control flow in Java

Problem Statement:

Develop a Java program that:

1. Generates a random number within a given range.
2. Prompts the user to guess the number.
3. Compares the user’s guess with the generated number.
4. Displays appropriate feedback based on the result.

Solution Overview:

Core Logic:

1. Use Java’s Random class to generate a number.
2. Read user input using the Scanner class.
3. Compare the generated number and user input.
4. Display whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.

Tools and Concepts Used:

1. java.util.Random – to generate random numbers
2. java.util.Scanner – to take user input
3. if-else conditional statements
4. Loops (optional enhancement)
5. Basic console output

Program Flow:

1. Program generates a random number
2. User is prompted to enter a guess
3. Program compares guess with random number
4. Appropriate message is displayed
5. Program terminates

* The Random Number Guessing Game is a simple yet effective Java project that demonstrates core programming principles. Completing such tasks helps interns transition from theoretical knowledge to practical application and builds a strong foundation for advanced Java development.
